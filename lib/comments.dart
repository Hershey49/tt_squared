-We will need to see how Dart uses clicked states
-We will need to work on the algorythm for the game

-Worked on clicking functionality of each indvidual box. Ran into errors where clicks would apply to entire table/screen etc.
-(cont.) Fixed it by indexing the overall table and position in table in a List
- Used Gesture Detector to work on clicks
- For now only changes on Tap to X. Researching if terniary statements in Dart are possible, because that will be very useful
-(cont.) for changing player turns/states in case of mistakes. 
- Reset Function that sets the state of all instances to 0?

-Created a base Home, Stats, Info Page for the future. Made buttons to go from Home Page to the 3 pages.
-Need to do research on icons to replace the buttons with icons in the future (if needed)
-Ran into a problem where you can't have 2 Elevated Buttons in the same child so had to fix that.
-Next steps are working on the algorythm (checkWinner function), will need to do some research on this.
-Made modifications to _tapped function that prevents player overruling existing pieces
-CheckWinner Function + Player Win count increment
-Research how we can use Firebase for Authentication
